# SLAM Robot — ROS 2 + Gazebo Ground-Truth Benchmarking

[![Engineering CI](https://github.com/vasu4990/slam-robot-ros2/actions/workflows/checks.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/vasu4990/slam-robot-ros2/actions/workflows/checks.yml)

An engineering-grade ROS 2 stack for a differential-drive robot performing **2D LiDAR SLAM, pose-graph localization, Gazebo physics simulation, and quantitative trajectory benchmarking**.

> **Reference platform:** ROS 2 **Lyrical Luth (LTS)** + Gazebo **Jetty**.  
> **Status:** simulation architecture and offline evaluators are implemented; a successful Gazebo runtime, SLAM benchmark, rosbag regression, and physical-robot validation are still evidence-gated.

## What is now in this repository

- lifecycle-managed `slam_toolbox` mapping and localization;
- strict `map -> odom -> base_footprint -> base_link -> laser_link` ownership;
- Gazebo Jetty physics world with loop-rich indoor geometry;
- differential-drive physics with wheel-derived odometry;
- 360° noisy simulated LiDAR;
- a separate Gazebo world-pose odometry publisher bridged as `/ground_truth/odom`;
- explicit ROS↔Gazebo bridge configuration;
- deterministic square-loop benchmark driver;
- runtime trajectory recorder comparing ground truth against `map -> base_footprint`;
- best-fit SE(2) ATE and fixed-delta RPE metrics;
- long-horizon loop-closure revisit scoring;
- occupancy-map quality metrics;
- CPU/RSS process profiling;
- repeatable rosbag record/replay scripts;
- machine-readable benchmark thresholds and scenarios;
- evidence-based maturity gates that keep simulation and hardware claims separate.

## Simulation architecture

```

The Gazebo `DiffDrive` odometry is intentionally **not** used as ground truth. Ground truth comes from a separate Gazebo odometry publisher attached to the model and derived from simulator world pose.

## Run the physics simulator

```bash
ros2 launch slam_robot_ros2 simulation.launch.py headless:=false
```

Headless:

```bash
ros2 launch slam_robot_ros2 simulation.launch.py headless:=true
```

## Run SLAM + ground-truth recording

```bash
ros2 launch slam_robot_ros2 simulation_mapping.launch.py \
  headless:=true \
  record_trajectory:=true \
  run_benchmark_driver:=true
```

The benchmark driver is simulation-only by default. It publishes a deterministic loop path from `config/benchmark_path.yaml`.

## Record a regression rosbag

```bash
bash scripts/record_benchmark.sh gazebo_loop_square
```

Recorded topics include `/scan`, `/odom`, `/ground_truth/odom`, `/tf`, `/tf_static`, `/map`, `/diagnostics`, and `/clock`.

Replay:

```bash
bash scripts/replay_benchmark.sh artifacts/bags/gazebo_loop_square
```

## Quantitative trajectory evaluation

The recorder creates:

```text
stamp_s,gt_x,gt_y,gt_yaw,est_x,est_y,est_yaw
```

Evaluate it:

```bash
python tools/trajectory_metrics.py artifacts/trajectory.csv \
  --output artifacts/trajectory-metrics.json
python tools/loop_closure_metrics.py artifacts/trajectory.csv \
  --output artifacts/loop-metrics.json
```

ATE uses best-fit rigid **SE(2) alignment only**. There is no scale correction, because a metric LiDAR SLAM system should preserve scale. RPE evaluates relative motion over a fixed sample delta.

## Benchmark gate

Simulation thresholds live in `benchmarks/thresholds.yaml` and are explicitly marked as regression targets, not hardware specifications.

```bash
bash scripts/evaluate_benchmark.sh artifacts/trajectory.csv artifacts/map.pgm
```

## CPU and memory profiling

```bash
python tools/process_profile.py \
  --duration 90 \
  --match slam_toolbox \
  --match gz \
  --match ros_gz_bridge \
  --output artifacts/resource-profile.json
```

Compare resource results only on the same host / scenario / rendering mode.

## Evidence maturity

| Gate | Current |
|---|---|
| Static engineering reference | ✅ |
| Gazebo model/world contract | ✅ |
| ROS Lyrical build | ❌ until CI evidence |
| Gazebo runtime | ❌ until launch evidence |
| Ground-truth bridge | ❌ until runtime evidence |
| SLAM simulation benchmark | ❌ |
| ATE/RPE benchmark | ❌ |
| Loop-closure benchmark | ❌ |
| Resource profile | ❌ |
| Rosbag replay regression | ❌ |
| Hardware TF/mapping | ❌ |
| Hardware localization | ❌ |

This is intentional. `config/robot.yaml` is the source of truth; simulation success is not allowed to silently become a physical-robot claim.

## Physical robot next step

The hardware stage requires actual LiDAR + encoder evidence: measured wheel radius/separation, encoder resolution, LiDAR pose and timing, TF audit, real rosbags, map artifacts, repeatability runs and failure notes. See `docs/HARDWARE_EVIDENCE.md`.
